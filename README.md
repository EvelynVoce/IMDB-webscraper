# IMDB-webscraper
 
This web scraper was built to quickly scrape media data from IMDB. Crawling the site and extracting data on as many films and TV shows as possible.
Limitations were added to stop the scraper from collecting data on lesser known content and multi-processing was used to speed up the process considerably.
This data was then used in the open-source suggestion algorithm I made as an example data set.
